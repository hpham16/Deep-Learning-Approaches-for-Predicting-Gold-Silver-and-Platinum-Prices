# Deep-Learning-Approaches-for-Predicting-Gold-Silver-and-Platinum-Prices

•	This study focuses on predicting the prices of gold, silver, and platinum, which are crucial metals in the financial and investment markets. Predicting the prices of these metals poses a significant challenge due to the influence of complex factors such as politics, economics, and global market conditions.

•	Our dataset consists of real-world data, encompassing the historical prices of gold, silver, and platinum over an extended period. This data is organized as time series, including information on the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices. Additionally, we have gathered various economic indicators and market factors to examine their correlations and impacts on the prices of these precious metals.

•	We have utilized a range of algorithms and models to predict the prices of gold, silver, and platinum. These algorithms include ARIMA, RNN, GRU, Linear Regression, VAR, Random Forest, Hybrid Neural Networks (HNN), Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR), and Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks (MRNN). Each algorithm employs its unique approach to handle time series data and correlate various factors.

•	During the research process, we conducted data preprocessing, trained the models, and evaluated their performance on the test dataset. Performance metrics such as mean error and correlation coefficient were employed to assess the accuracy of the prediction models.

•	The findings of this study hold significant value for investors, financial experts, and risk management organizations. By understanding and predicting the trends and price fluctuations of these metals, they can make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies to maximize profits and minimize risks in the precious metals market.
